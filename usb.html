      <h1>Stage 3: USB Quandaries</h1>
      <p>&emsp;&emsp;I'm trying to make my own version (rip-off) of USB drives in order to make loads of profit.  In order to make my PSB (Proprietary Serial Bus) drives, I need to know how USB drives erase their memory.  I found the image below that seems to be related to the process, but someone obscured the important part of the image.  Who knew a universal standard was under so much secracy.  Can you help me figure out the process by which erasure is done?</p>

      <button id="sub" onclick="validateForm()" class="button">Submit</button>
