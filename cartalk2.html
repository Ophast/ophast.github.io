      <p>&emsp;&emsp;I hope you liked those Car Talk puzzlers, because you'll have to solve one to advance to the next stage!  You may want to grab a pencil a paper for this one!  This doozy of a puzzler comes from Terry Sare, but I've adjusted it a bit.  Terry writes,</p>
      <p class="paper">
      &emsp;&emsp;I was driving on the highway the other day recently and I happened to notice my odometer.  Like most odometers nowadays, it shows six digits in whole miles -- no tenths of a mile.  At the time, my car had miles in the hundred thousands, so my odometer was showing 6 digits with no leading zeros.
      <br/><br/>
      &emsp;&emsp;Now, what I saw that day was very interesting. I noticed that the last 4 digits formed a palindrome.  Even more interesting, one mile later, the last 5 numbers were palindromic.  Another mile later, the middle 4 digits of 6 were palindromic.  Now, this may seem unbelievable, but one mile later, all 6 digits formed a palindrome!
      <br/><br/>
      &emsp;&emsp;Assuming I'm not a liar, how many miles were on my odometer when I first looked at it?
