      <h1>Stage 1: Car Talk</h1>
      <p>&emsp;&emsp;My buddy's car has started behaving weirdly and I'm not quite sure what's gone wrong with it.  I told him you're pretty experienced with cars, so he's sent me the following text describing the symptoms his car has been having.  Do you know what's gone bad?</p>
      <p class="paper">Yeah, so the other day it stalled and left me stranded when I stopped at the intersection of Forbes and Morewood.  Before that, I thought I might have heard some backfiring and the car was running all weird.  It was really jerky and was idling really rough.  I probably should have pulled over earlier, but I was trying to make it to the gas station nearby after realizing that my gas was pretty low.  It may just be my faulty memory, but I'm pretty sure I filled up the gas tank way too recently to have to fill it up again, and it caught me off guard.</p>
